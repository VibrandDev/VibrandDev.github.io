                            <p>Vibrand Opinion offers in depth analytics on social media through our partnership with Crimson Hexagon, arguably the world’s leading social media analytics platform.</p><p>
Crimson Hexagon has stored the entire world’s conversation on social media from 2008 – almost 1 trillion pieces of social media data. This includes all social media platforms – twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, blogs and forums. </p><p>
Crimson Hexagon’s proprietary array of analytics tools allows us to analyse this massive data set. Using algorithms and adaptive learning it can process and analyse billions of tweets, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr and blog posts – sorting and making sense of the conversation. We can run this analysis by country, region or globally.
We are always looking at what people are saying about an issue, or how they are feeling about a topic. We can answer practically any question - from the general to the specific; from the conceptual to the practical.</p><p>
The amazing thing about social media data is that it is simultaneously quantitative and qualitative, and both will always be included in our reporting. The macro and the micro come standard!</p><p>
It is quantitative in that, even with a very specific topic we meaningfully access and analyse anything from hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions of pieces of social media data.</p><p>
It is qualitative in that the more we drill down the more we are able to explore what individual people say about specific topics of interest. Personal stories abound - what did individual people say - about specific topics, at specific times and in specific contexts.</p><p>
Our platform can answer almost any question, if framed as follows:</br><strong>
What do people who are active on social media in any given country/region or globally feel or think about any topic of interest.</strong>

                             <p>So while ‘social listening’ solutions abound, we challenge you to look at this more broadly.  This is not social listening, and this is not a product – it is a gargantuan data source with the necessary tools to mine it. </p><p>
We go way beyond just looking at brands and what people say about them. We are able to look at categories, behaviours and themes in an analytic way.  We are also able to look at these topics over an 8 year period, so we can analyse change over time. </p><p>
We can look at analytics on contributors to a conversation – their interests and preferences, their influence and their views. And we can look at the affinities and interests of various groups of people (by category and by brand usage).</p><p>
We have done some work in the public sphere on this platform at our sister organisation, the <a href="http://www.citizenresearchcentre.org" target="_blank">Citizen Research Centre</a>.

And if you are interested in unpacking African opinion on your brand, product or category, take a look at the Citizen Research Centre’s <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/africa-twitter-index.html" target="_blank">Twitter Activity Index</a>. </p><p>This gives an accurate account of twitter traffic in 52 African countries, and we use it to advise on where and whether to run country specific social media projects across the continent.
