                            <p><strong>While we think everything about Vibrand is pretty fabulous, there is something extra-special about Vibrand Reach.</strong></p><p>
Vibrand Reach is our face-to-face interviewing solution. Through our partnerships with the best independent research agencies across all African regions and the Middle East, Reach is available in 54 countries (click here for the list).</p><p>
Reach was initially developed and implemented around the needs of our social clients, who require unprecedented penetration into difficult-to-reach markets.
Of course, our corporate Clients were soon to follow!</p><p>
Reach is an agile, adaptive research solution that utilises technology and partnerships to deliver face-to face consumer interviews. It is centrally managed, with field teams that number in the thousands. We run short (7-10 minutes) interviews with consumers in the streets of hundreds of cities and towns. Interviewers operate where they live, so the research process is a very active one – with field teams interviewing people on the streets across the continent. In some countries (like Nigeria) we have field teams in as many as 50 cities and towns.</p><p>
Our interviewers use a global standard surveying platform to conduct interviews on android devices. They are able to run these interviews on- and off-line –and these are then uploaded onto our platform.</p><p>
This allows us to see the data as it comes in from any one of the 54 countries that we cover. We are able to see which interviews were conducted by which field team members, and have numerous anomaly detectors built into the platform. These include text message back checking and audio recording of random questions to ensure compliance on the face-to-face interviewing requirements. The data is then cleaned, analysed and reported on from our offices.
