                    <p>We provide all the ‘usual’ qual methods – and we do them very, very well.  From brief to proposal, RQ to DG to choosing the right moderator, quick turn-around topline results to final presentations personally delivered by MD Stuart who draws on over 20 years’ experience to deliver extraordinary insights. We provide qual work throughout SA, and in over 20 other African countries. Through our partner network, we are also able to run multi-country Africa projects simultaneously – up to five countries at a time.</p><p>
 
Our highly customised approach to quant work is specifically tailored to your project. We bring the methods we have learned from sensory work into the mix, and inevitably offer all that you’d expect with some surprising extras - conjoint, CATA and JAR analysis tend to come at no extra charge.</p><p>
 
We will always go the extra mile for you, and that includes being highly competitive on cost.</p><p>
