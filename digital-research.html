                        <p><strong>Imagine…</strong> running ethnographic IDIs and deep insight work with 30 consumers, along with a  few focus groups and getting all the feedback in 2 weeks. Including video, photos, and a deep dive into your consumers lives as they live them.
                        Then quantifying the insights with 1000 consumers in 2 weeks – a full qual and quant study run in 4 weeks, and at 60% of the price of a traditional study.
